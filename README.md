# Jupyter-Boilerplate Project

This project provides configurations for using Jupyter and R together in VSCode. The `devcontainer.json` file specifies the Docker container configuration, leveraging the Remote-Containers feature in VSCode to provide a convenient, unified development environment.

## Getting Started

1. First, install VSCode, Docker, and the VSCode extension that enables the Remote-Containers feature.

2. Create a new repository from this boilerplate.

3. Clone the new repository.

3. Open VSCode and use the Remote-Containers feature to open the project. This will automatically create and start the Docker container as defined.

Or you can use GitHub Codespaces.
